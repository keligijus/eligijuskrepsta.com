## Background

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    I’ve been excited about chat bots, voice and serverless applications ever since I’ve heard about them. Alexa Skills have it all, they’re kind of chat bots controlled by voice and hosted on cloud solutions provided by AWS.

## Designing for voice

Building voice applications is really fun and challenging. I’ve found that understanding the context is crucial to providing a good user experience.

## Result

I’ve received a single 5 star review which is exciting and motivates to build more Skills. I’m surely going to be expanding my porftolio of Alexa Skills in future.
