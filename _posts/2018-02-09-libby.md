## Summary

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">

Founders of Libby are on a mission to help students save on textbooks. Hence they've come up with a plan for uselibby.com a marketplace where students can trade textbooks with their peers. I joined them to build a web application for the marketplace.

## My Contributions

We've worked closely with the founders to plan the application, user journeys and actions, determine how the transactions should work and all other technical aspects of the application.

Eventually we had architected the application, picked a tech stack that works for us and built the app.

I've built a Single Page Application with Angular on frontend and an ExpressJS powered API on backend.

<!-- Integrations with Braintree Payments and third party price comparison APIs were made. -->


## Integration with Braintree

Payments are powered by Braintree Payments. Their API allows Libby to act as a mediator between the seller and buyer. Transaction funds are kept in escrow account until the purchase is final and confirmed by the buyer.

This makes the purchase process safe for both parties.

On the backend we're using Braintree API to deal with payments and the movement of funds.


## Price Comparison Tool

In addition to purchasing a book on the marketplace, students can look for best prices on from other sellers.

Price comparison uses multiple external APIs to check for lowest prices. Libby app fetches and aggregates the data, then displays the results in a user friendly way.
